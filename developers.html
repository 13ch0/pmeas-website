                <p>This project was developed by four Wayne State University students for the CSC4996 <i>(Senior Project)</i>. Under the guidance of Dr. Khayyam Hashmi and Dr. Sam Bryfczynski, the project evolved from a simple application with a basic UI to a more fully featured application with an accompanying mobile application. For any questions about the project, you may contact the developers by <a href="mailto:fp1039@wayne.edu">e-mail</a> or by filling out the <a href="contact.html">Contact Us Form</a>.
