                <p>At its core, the PMEAS system relies on audio modulation to apply effects to audio being played from an instrument. Audio modulation allows a system to take in a raw audio feed from an instrument and modify the wave to change how it will sound when it is output to a speaker. A good example of this is the wave displayed in the gif that is shown below.</p>

                <p>In the gif, the raw audio data is visualized above as a standard wave. The wave represented by the <em>AM</em> label is the effect we want to apply to the raw audio signal. When this is done, the wave labeled <em>FM</em> is our modulated audio signal. This is the audio signal that gets sent to the speaker to be projected to an audience. The idea behind PMEAS is through the application of several modulation signals like <em>AM</em>, we can modulate audio in a way that simulates the analog nature of instrument pedals.
